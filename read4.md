## What is Javascript?


#### Javascript is a programming language used to add more functionality to web pages, since usually a web page consisting only from HTML and CSS codes will not be that dynamic nor interactive, so Javascript comes to the rescue by its advanced features and fast execution. Moreover, Javascript usually comes to play along with the other two languages mentioned before, namely, HTML and CSS, where it can access HTML elements and alter thier presentation which is altered by CSS.

 ### Expressions and Operators
An expression is a set of values that is operated upon via some kind of a command or operators, and the defining character of expressions is that they always return a value and can be assigned to variables.

There are a number of types of operators on Javascript, operators usualy operate on at least one value, depending on thier functionality, and they return another value, the most basic example on operators is the plus sign ‘+’ which is used to sum two numbers and return the result.

 ## Types of Operators:
* Assignment operators –> Example: =
* Comparison operators –> Example: >
* Arithmetic operators –> Example: +
* Bitwise operators –> Example: »>
* Logical operators –> Example: or
* String operators –> Example: +
* Conditional (ternary) operator –> Example: ? :
* Comma operator –> Example: ,
* Unary operators –> Example: delete
* Relational operators –> Example: in
